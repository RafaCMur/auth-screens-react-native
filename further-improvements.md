## Further Improvements

- Add version control and a CHANGELOG.md
- Add a database for managing users and passwords independently from the local code.
- Multi-language support (i18n).
- Implement unit and integration tests (Selenium, playwright, etc).
- This project is using only a “main” branch but this is because it is only a trial project. A “develop” branch could be added and then feature, fix, release branches from develop.
- A Modal could be used instead of Alert

## Possible improvements for CI/CD

- Automatic upload to app marketplaces (appstore, google play store).
- The process of obtaining the release link automatically without having to upload the apk to google drive could be implemented as an improvement.
- Feedback in Slack with Jenkins (have seen this in my previous company)
- Automate iOS builds.
